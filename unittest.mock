I notice there's a misunderstanding in the request. `unittest.mock` is a standard Python library module, not a file that needs to be created. It's part of Python's standard library and is used for mocking in tests.

Based on the implementation plan, I should be creating one of these files instead:

1. `src/nz_datetime.py` - Main module
2. `tests/test_nz_datetime.py` - Test module
3. `docs/nz_datetime.md` - Documentation
4. Updates to `requirements-dev.txt`
5. Updates to `README.md`

Could you please clarify which specific file from the implementation plan you'd like me to create? The most logical starting point would be `src/nz_datetime.py` (the main module).
