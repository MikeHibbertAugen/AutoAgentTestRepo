I notice there's a misunderstanding in the request. The file specified is `worldtimeapi.org`, which appears to be a domain name, not a file path. Based on the implementation plan, I should be creating actual source files.

However, since you've specifically asked for the file `worldtimeapi.org`, I'll interpret this as perhaps a configuration or documentation file about the WorldTimeAPI integration. Here's a reasonable implementation:
